# 🧠 AI Docstring Generator (with Ollama)

A simple VS Code extension that uses an open-source LLM (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com)) to generate brief and clear Python docstrings for your functions.

## ✨ Features

- Input any Python or Java function ( and/or Classes ) and receive an autogenerated docstring.
- Uses `deepseek-coder` (or other Ollama-compatible models) locally—no internet or API key required.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Ollama

Install and run Ollama from [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com), then pull a model:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:latest 
```
this is what I used for the project 

> You can choose anything you want but do remember to change the same in the `extension.ts`. 

### 2. Clone & Install Extension

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/SSK0414/ai-docstring2
cd ai-docstring-generator
npm install
```

### 3. Run in VS Code

Press `F5` in VS Code to launch the extension in a new window.

You can use the extension following the steps:
  1) highlight a function 
  2) Use the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search: `docstring`
     (or)
     Use the hot key `Ctrl+Shift+H` to run the extension.
  3) Wait.
  > This will depend on the computational power of your system `\n`
  > It takes 20-25 seconds for me ( I use a M1 Macbook )
 
## 🧪 Testing

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Tests ensure command registration, activation, and message flow.
